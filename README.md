# Machine Learning 
This is a machine learning book, which I started to write as a book for my own reference. It includes the following:
- A deeper coverage of math behind the models than the usual books. These will come in appendices.
- A set of useful jupyter notebooks for getting hands-on experience. 


# What is not covered and hopefully will be covered soon:
1. A friendly guide to use VS code, Bash, Github for a quick and practical start.
2. Covering missing topics
    - Deep Learning, NNs, RNNs, CNNs,
    - Reinforcement Learning
        - Gen AI
    - Unsupervised_learning Chapter
        -  PCA 
        -  Anomaly detection  
    - Supervised Learning Chapter
        - Regularized Regression (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net)
3. A friendly guide to cloud services: GCP, AWS, Azure
